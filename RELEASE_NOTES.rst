Features
========

Display
-------

The |BOARD_NAME| board can use the Apollo4 Plus EVB Display Kit. 

The Apollo4 Plus EVB Display Kit features a 545 * 545 AMOLED display.  The pixel format
is 8 bits-per-pixel. The display device is connected to the MCU via a I2C link.
It uses a NEMA GPU of Think Silicon.

For more information, please refer to the Quick Start Guide of the display shield available `here <https://ambiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apollo4-Plus-Display-Kit-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf>`__.

MicroUI requires a RAM buffer to store the dynamic images data.  A
dynamic image is an image decoded at runtime (PNG image) or an image created
by the Application using the ``Image.create(width, height)`` API.
This buffer is located in external RAM.


Known issues/limitations
========================

GPU freeze
----------

The GPU can have some issues with resources located in the MRAM (ERR105) or the SRAM (ERR049).
Even though the MRAM issue is not mentioned in the errata list of the Apollo4 Plus board, we did encounter the problem ERR049
mentioned in the errata list of the Apollo4.
For more information, pleaser refer to the errata list of the
`Apollo4 Plus <https://ambiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Apollo4-Plus-Silicon-Errata-List.pdf>`__
or `Apollo4 <https://ambiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Apollo4-Silicon-Errata-List.pdf>`__ board.
